 98 files successfully parsed
 8 failed

Reasons of failure:

 * gentest.n3 - triple quoted literal ended by a single quote
 * one_trip_per_month.n3 - use of symbols which are just plain keywords (eg. `OneTripPerMonthAgent'), it looks like cwm.py succeed to parse it though, but it doesn't seem to fit the reference grammar... (same problem with parsing the grammar itself)
 * powder4.n3 - same thing ( `suitableFor')
 * rdfcore-tests.n3 - 
 	:entailmentRules rdf:, rdfs:, dat:
	the dcg does not handle direct ref to the namespace URI
 * t10.n3 -
 	@prefix default <#> .
	the `default' keyword is not handled
 * t2.n3 - 
 	>- and -> symbols not supported 
 * t7.n3 - 
 	same thing
 * weird-syntax.n3
 	quite obvious:-)
