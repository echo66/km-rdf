SWILIB

This library defines a data-identifiers mechanism to manage large data objects. It also defines a library to control Pl_term_t blobs (Which is deprecated after introducing the ids mechanism). This library gives support to SWI-DSP in data management and is available for PROLOG from the swidata module.
