								CLASSIFIERS OPTIONS

1 . COMMON OPTIONS FOR wkpl_run_classifier(ClassifierName, Options, Statistics)

-t filename
Name of the file with the training data. (required)

-T filename
Name of the file with the test data. If missing a cross-validation is performed.

-c index
Index of the class attribute (1, 2, ...; default: last).

-x number
The number of folds for the cross-validation (default: 10).

-no-cv
No cross validation. If no test file is provided, no evaluation is done.

-split-percentage percentage
Sets the percentage for the train/test set split, e.g., 66.

-preserve-order
Preserves the order in the percentage split instead of randomizing the data first with the seed value ('-s').

-s seed
Random number seed for the cross-validation and percentage split (default: 1).

-m filename
The name of a file containing a cost matrix.

-l filename
Loads classifier from the given file. In case the filename ends with ".xml" the options are loaded from XML.

-d filename
Saves classifier built from the training data into the given file. In case the filename ends with ".xml" the options are saved XML, not the model.

-v
Outputs no statistics for the training data.

-o
Outputs statistics only, not the classifier.

-i
Outputs information-retrieval statistics per class.

-k
Outputs information-theoretic statistics.

-p range
Outputs predictions for test instances (or the train instances if no test instances provided), along with the attributes in the specified range (and nothing else). Use '-p 0' if no attributes are desired.

-distribution
Outputs the distribution instead of only the prediction in conjunction with the '-p' option (only nominal classes).

-r
Outputs cumulative margin distribution (and nothing else).

-g
Only for classifiers that implement "Graphable." Outputs the graph representation of the classifier (and nothing else).

-xml filename | xml-string
Retrieves the options from the XML-data instead of the command line.

-threshold-file file
The file to save the threshold data to. The format is determined by the extensions, e.g., '.arff' for ARFF format or '.csv' for CSV.

-threshold-label label
The class label to determine the threshold data for (default is the first label)
