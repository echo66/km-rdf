							HOW TO USE SWIWEKA (Quick guide)


1. How To Create a Dataset using dataSet.pl

The program dataSet.pl is an interface to deal with the elements of the weka.core. The dataSet is just a weka.core.Instances object which we create and define with attributes and instance objects. The user should check out the WEKA reference about ARFF files before keeping reading this document.


1.1. CREATION 

We have several ways to create a dataSet:

-wkpl_read_arff(+File, -Dataset): This predicate loads a arff file and creates a weka Instances representation of it.

-wkpl_create_empty_dataSet(+Name, -Dataset): This predicates creates a dataset without attributes and the only information given is the name of the @relation field (name of the dataset).

-wkpl_create_dataSet(+Name, +ListOfNumericalAt, +ListOfNominalAt, +Capacity, -Dataset) where

	ListOfNumericalAt is a list of the names of the numerical attributes like [param1, year, duration, parameter2]
	ListOfNominalAt is a list of nominal and exceptionally string (empty lists) attributes like ['nominal'(genre, [rock, pop, country]), 		'nominal'(title, [])]

	Note: The numerical ones will be at the top and the nominal and the end, so if this is not desired it's necessary to create and empty one and 
	attributes one by one.

	Note: The capacity doesn't seem to be relevant but it's necessary to create the dataSet.


1.2. ADD ATTRIBUTES

If the DataSet is empty or we need to add more attributes we can do it with the predicates wkpl_add_attribyte_xxxx/2 very easily. We need to specify the Index of them though, so that needs to be checked before adding them.


1.3. CLASS ATTRIBUTE

Normally, the classifiers need a Class attribute so it has to be set with

-wkpl_set_class(+DataSet, +Attribute): given the attribute object

-wkpl_set_classIndex(+DataSet, +Index): given the index of the attribute to be the class. (starting from 0).


1.4. FILLING DATA ON THE DATASET

To fill the data we just use one predicate 

-wkpl_fill_dataSet(+DataSet, +ListOfRecords) where

	ListOfRecords is a prolog list containing the values as a list (normally just double values as internal weka representation) for each attribute 	in a specific Instance object. For example:
					
		:-wkpl_fill_dataSet(DataSet, [[234.89, 45.9, 0.0], [675.45, 29.0, 1.0]])


1.5. QUERYING DATASET

There is a bunch of predicates to query the dataSet (look the source)


1.6. TESTING SETS, TRAINING SETS

There is a bunch of predicates to create testing and training sets.


1.7. SAVING DATASET

wkpl_write_arff(File, DataSet) stores our DataSet in a ARFF file given the path to it.
