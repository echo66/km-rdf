We recommend to use swiweka from the classification front-end.

1. INSTALL

To successfully use swiweka, please follow these instructions

1- Download the Linux package from the weka website and copy weka.jar and weka-src.jar into the swiweka folder
2- Set the jar in the classpath in the bash
3- Load weka.pl module from the Prolog prompt

Go :)

2. CONTENT

This is an interface that allows to use the WEKA API for classification within the KM just with some predicates. It's built on the JPL interface available for SWI-Prolog as package (Paul Singleton). The detailed information is so far at the sources. The interface contains the following Prolog programs:

--jpl_weka. This is a bunch of intermediate tools used to make easier the handling of WEKA using JPL. Some of them are deprecated and not used anymore

--dataSet. This is the main part of the interface. It mainly wraps the weka.core. package of WEKA to deal with datasets (Instance, Attribute and    	Instance objects)

--fastVector: Just few predicates to handle the weka.fastVector class

--arffFiles: Input/Output operations over ARFF file formats (The basic format supported by WEKA).

--resources: Analyzer of the WEKA API to deal with its elements

--classifiers: common predicates to deal with classifier objects

--runclassification: common calls to run classifiers

--Examples/: few examples of how to use the dataset predicates.
