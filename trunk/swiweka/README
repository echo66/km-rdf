SWIWEKA MODULE KM.
David Pastor Escuredo 2008, c4dm, Queen Mary, University of London.

This is an interface that allows to use the WEKA API for classification within the KM just with some predicates. It's built on the JPL interface available for SWI-Prolog as package (Paul Singleton). The detailed information is so far at the sources. The interface contains the following Prolog programs:

--jpl_weka. This is a bunch of intermediate tools used to make easier the handling of WEKA using JPL. Some of them are deprecated and not used anymore

--dataSet. This is the main part of the interface. It mainly wraps the weka.core. package of WEKA to deal with datasets (Instance, Attribute and Instance objects)

--fastVector: Just few predicates to handle the weka.fastVector class

--arrffFiles: Input/Output operations over ARFF file formats (The basic format supported by WEKA).

--classifiers: Hides the constructors of each classifier with wkpl_classifier/2. The predicates are set with no options. Classifiers can be also created from classification.pl

--classification: common calls to classifiers based on weka.classifiers.Classifier abstract class. It allows to set options and call the commong functions that each classifier must implement.

--swiwekadb stuff: was aimed to handle ids for each JPL ref to java objects, but presents some garbage-collection problems.

--Examples/: few examples of how to use the dataset predicates.
