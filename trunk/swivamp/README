1. "vamp" Module

This module defines public predicates to deal with Vamp Plugins from a SWI-Prog machine.

The module definition is presented bellow. The predicates are ordered by their relevance:

:- module(vamp,[plugins/1, 
		availablePlugin/1,
		plugin_for_audioFile/3, 
		plugin_for_information/1, 
		metaData/8,  
		plugin_outputs/2, 
		plugin_parameters/2, 
		plugin_programs/2, 
		initialize_plugin/1,
		prefInitPlugin_for_audioFile/2, 
		run_plugin_for_audioFile/4]).



run_plugin_for_audioFile(+pluginKey, +pathToAudioFile, +#output(starting from 0), -ListofFeatures)

	The list of features is a prolog term designed according to the Music Ontology (Yves Raimond). Thus, the results of the plugin can be exported
	in RDF format to the semantic web or retrieved from other client in terms of the ontology.

	ListofFeatures:  [outputName, #values/output, [features list for input frame 1], [features list for frame 2]|...].
	sublist:         [event(timestamp, values), event(timestamp, values)|...]
	
	where event(timestamp, values) is the representation of an audio feautre expressed in terms of the ontology.

	For given audio file, plugin and the desired output of such plugin (use plugin_outputs/2 to see the available plugins of each output), this
	predicate returns a list with the features obtained as described above.
	The Vamp Feature is an structure composed by: name, timestamp (sec, nsec) and vector of values.
	Each sublist is a list of the timestamps and values of the features obtained from an input block of data. If the feature does not has a
	specific timestamp, the timestamp of the frame is assigned to it.
	Then, the sublists are grouped on a bigger list with two fiels of information: name of the output and number of values/output.
	
plugins(-ListofPlugins)
	
	Returns a list of all the available plugins on the system named by their keys. Some examples are:
		qm-plugins-vamp:qm-keydetector
		qm-plugins-vamp:qm-chromagram 

	For the general documentation of it, please check the hostExt classes of the Vamp Plugins API http://www.vamp-plugins.org/code-doc/

plugin_outputs(+pluginKey, -ListofOutputs)
	
	Returns a list of the name of the outputs of a plugin. Thus, it is possible to know which output we want to obtain for a plugin. For N outputs	
	we need to insert a number from 0 to N-1.

prefInitPlugin_for_audioFile(+pluginKey, +pathToAudioFile)
	
	This predicates instantiates and intializes the plugin indicated by pluginKey for the given audio file (path to it). The predicate creates the 
	plugin with the sample rate obtaiend from the audio file. The initialization is carried out with the preferred block and step sizes of the 
	plugin and with the number of channels of the audio file. We do not need to take care of the number of channels as the plugin to be created is
	a ChannelAdapter plugin that will mix or multiplex the audio file to match the number of channels of the plugin.
	


2. swivamp.cpp

This is communication layer between SWI-Prolog and the Vamp API (Chris Cannam and c4dm) for audio features extraction. This interface wraps the methods of the class Plugin (that wraps the C API into a more friendly C++ implementation for development) allowing the management of the plugin lifecyle (see Plugin documentation) from a SWI-prolog host.
This source file is implemented on the Jan Wielemeker's C++/SWI-Prolog and enhanced with the C/SWI-Prolog foreign interface.

LIST OF C/Prolog FUNCTIONS
	
term_t
features_to_prologList(Vamp::Plugin::FeatureSet, int);
	
	This function creates a prolog list from the FeatureList Vamp::Plugin::FeatureSet fs[int output]

Vamp::RealTime 
get_timeStamp(term_t);

	This function creates a Vamp::RealTime object from a prolog list [sec, nsec]

term_t
prolog_timeStamp(Vamp::RealTime);

	This function creates a prolog list [sec, nsec] from a Vamp::RealTime object

term_t
plugin_remainingFeatures(int);

	This process wrapps the Vamp::Plugin::getRemainingFeatures() returning a prolog list for the given output instead of a FeatureSet

term_t
plugin_process(const float* const*, Vamp::RealTime, int);
	

	This process wrapss the Vamp::Plugin::process(const float* const*, Vamp::RealTime) function returning a prolog list for a given output 
	instead of a Vamp::Plugin::FeatureSet

**VERY IMPORTANT**: his last two functions are hybrids as they has C++ types as input and a Prolog term as output. They have been implemented this way because it is easier to pass the input blocks of data inside the loop of run_plugin than pass the input as prolog list. However I can try to change it if required.

LIST OF FOREIGN PREDICATES

PREDICATE(run_plugin, 3)
{	
	//+the audio file passed as input
	//+the output selected. 
	//-big prolog list: [output, number of values/output, [sublists of features for each input block],....]
	//the working plugin pointed by the global pointer: plugin.

	*implementation...
}
