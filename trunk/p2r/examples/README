Here is an example of how to wrap the Jamendo data set
(creative commons music collection) in a SPARQL end-point
using p2r. 

The following modules are available:

 * jamendo_xml: load the jamendo xml dump, you can get it from:
 http://wiki.jamendo.com/index.php/EnXMLDumps

 * jamendo: prolog representation of the jamendo data set

 * jamendo_match: mapping between this prolog representation and the
