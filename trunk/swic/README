----------------

QUICK DESCRIPTION:

SWIC is a set of Prolog modules allowing to access the Semantic Web dynamically, by
dereferencing useful URIs, or by querying SPARQL end points.
It provides an unique interface for doing both.

This is somehow similar to both the Semantic Web Client Library and  Rasqal.


----------------

INSTALL:

Untar, and launch ./run.pl
You may need the CVS version of SWI-Prolog
http://www.swi-prolog.org/

There is a small help available, just type "h."
This help also holds some examples.
