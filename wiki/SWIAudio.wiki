#Module for audio files decoding

= Introduction =

This module provides audio signal representations and functions to deal with them. The audio elements are represented by SWI-Prolog functors: signal(SampleRate, ListOfData), frame(SampleRate, Start, ListOfData) and timestamp(Start, Duration).

The sources of the terms are open source libraries communicating with SWI-Prolog through the foreign interface swiaudio.so. This interface provides a decode/2 predicate which decodes audio files returning a "signal term" common for every file format. These signal terms can be manipulated with predicates defined in this module and serve for communication with other modules that analyse audio information (see km-rdf general doc)

The list of file extensions supported:

.wav,
 .aif,
 .aiff,
 .mp3,
 .ogg,
 .m4a, (these last two are only stable for the Linux built)
 .aac.

= Details =

This module relies on external open source libraries which communicates with Prolog by the foreign libraries imported by this module. These libraries are MAD, FISHSOUND, OGGZ, FAAD and SOUNDFILE.

The data is managed using the swidata module and the BLOBIDs mechanism (see wiki page).
