P2R
----

A set of modules allowing you to export
prolog predicates as RDF just by declaring
mappings, and access them through a SPARQL 
end-point.

Installation & running
--

 1) Get the SeRQL library from here:
 http://gollem.science.uva.nl/twiki/pl/bin/view/Library/SeRQL
 and copy the SeRQL/ directory in the p2r/ one.
 Replace the sparql.pl and http_sparql.pl files in SeRQL using the one provided in P2R.

 2) Write your mappings, and load them into run.pl, as
 well as your prolog stuff.

 3) Access the SPARQL end point from here:
 http://localhost:3020/
 and use "p2r" entailment
