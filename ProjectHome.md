This project aims at gathering a number of tools, based on the SWI semweb library and developed at the Centre for Digital Music, Queen Mary, University of London.

The following component are available within this project:

  * Henry 1 - A simple SWI-Prolog N3 parser/reasoner
  * Henry 2 - A DSP-driving SPARQL end point, based on transaction logic
  * SWIVamp - A SWI-Prolog interface for driving VAMP plugins (audio content analysis)
  * SWIAudio - A SWI-Prolog library for decoding a wide range of audio files
  * UriSpace - A component managing content negotiation in a URI space, providing either HTML or RDF representation of resources held within a SPARQL end-point
  * P2R (Prolog-2-RDF) - Provides a SPARQL end point on top of a Prolog knowledge base, translating on-the-fly SPARQL queries to Prolog queries
  * RDF-CTR - A concurrent transaction logic interpreter on top of a SWI RDF knowledge base
  * A number of content analysis (focused on musical audio) toolkit wrappers for Prolog
