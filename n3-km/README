HENRY (N3 parser and reasoner for SWI-Prolog)
------------------------------------------------

First: 
 
 * What are the known limitations?
    - A lot. Among them: bad handling of blank nodes
      (I think it almost works for now just thanks to an
      SWI bug, I will investigate that). Lack
      of recursive rule support (transitive predicate 
      handling and such...). Check out the issues list at:

      http://code.google.com/p/km-rdf/issues/list


Install:

 * Make sure you have SWI-Prolog installed:

   http://www.swi-prolog.org/

 * If you want to query your N3-entailed store
   using SPARQL, get SeRQL from:

   http://e-culture.multimedian.nl/software/ClioPatria.shtml

   And put the SeRQL directory in the Henry directory.


Use:

 * The swicwm.pl script behaves (almost) like the following command
   line, involving CWM (http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/doc/cwm.html):

   $ cwm $1 --think --rdf --data

 * From the Prolog command-line, you need to load n3_entailment.pl:
 
   ?- [n3_entailment].

   You can then load some n3 files using:
  
   ?- n3_load('file.n3').

   Or some RDF (XML or turtle) files using:

   ?- rdf_load('file.rdf').

   Then, you can compile the N3 rules you have in store using:

   ?- compile.

   Then, the derived statements are accessible through:

   ?- n3_entailment:rdf(Subject,Predicate,Object).
