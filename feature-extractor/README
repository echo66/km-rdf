This module defines feature extraction front for the km. So far we only can retrieve vamp features from the KM by means of swivamp, but we may
use some other tools to extract audio features. This interface should be responible of presenting just one view through some predicates for all the extractors so we have a unitary km-feature-extractor agent.
