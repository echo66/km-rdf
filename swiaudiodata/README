This is the "audiodata" module for SWI-Prolog.

This module combined with "audiosource" provides SWI-Prolog with a vocabulary to handle audio signals extracted from audio files. Representation of audio elements is done by means of prolog functors:

	signal(SampleRate, Data),
	frame(SampleRate, InitPosition, Data),
	timestamp(Start, Duration)
